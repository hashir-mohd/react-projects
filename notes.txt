React Notes:
-> no closing tag me backslash lgana, eg. <img src="" />.
->JSX me expression vs statement pass krne ka difference.only expression work.
->map function me key add krna.

dev-dependendies : do not go in production, work only when you create the project.
if we have react scripts in package.json then we dont need to add js file in html using script tag. it automatically do it.

-> <> </> : the content inside it is read as html, so if you have made a functio or object or constant previously then put them inside {} to show them on the webpage

->  setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
    setCounter(counter+1)
    output and what to do if we want to increase it one by one(we use callback)

-><button style={{backgroundColor:"yellow"}} onClick={() =>setColor("yellow")}>Yellow</button>: onclick expect a function as a parameter, therefore we cannot do onclick= setColor("yellow"), this give returned value of a functino as a parameter to onclick.
